🚀 **Introducing a Simple Python Script for API Health Checks!** 🚀

I'm excited to share a lightweight Python script that I've developed to help you ensure the reliability of your API endpoints. Regular health checks are essential for maintaining seamless user experiences and reducing developer headaches, and this script makes it incredibly easy to get started.

### 🛠️ Key Features:
- **Ease of Use**: Simple command-line interface for quick setup and execution.
- **Versatile HTTP Method Support**: Compatible with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, and OPTIONS.
- **Customizable Expected Status Codes**: Specify what HTTP status code you expect from each endpoint.

### How It Works:
The script sends an HTTP request to your specified API endpoint and compares the response status code to the expected status code. If they match, the endpoint is healthy; if not, it’s flagged as unhealthy.

### Quick Start:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pratyushsinha05/api-healthcheck.git
   cd api-healthcheck
   ```
2. **Run the Health Check**:
   ```sh
   python healthcheck.py --endpoint "http://your-api-endpoint.com" --method "GET" --expected 200
   ```

### Why You Should Use This:
Integrate this script into your routine checks or CI/CD pipeline for continuous monitoring and early issue detection, ensuring only healthy endpoints are deployed to production.
